      Smart2 supports a new interface named "tgui" which can 
      help you to customize your rootfs under character terminal in your development machine.
	  
      You will enter the tgui insterface with the option "--interface=tgui".
      For example:
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       $ smart --rootfs-dir=$ROOTFS_DIR  --interface=tgui
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Note
        --rootfs-dir: rootfs directory that specified by enviroment-smart.sh.

      After execute the above command, you can enter the interface of tgui:
      
      1) Select install type
         Smart2 supports three kinds of install type:
         - install all
           By default, all pacakges will be selected.
         - Busybox base
           By default, only busybox packages will be selected.
         - customize
           By default, no packages will be selected.

 
      2) Smart2 can help you filter GPLv3.
         If you select "install all" or "customize" in above, smart2 will ask you whether 
         you want to install packages which license is GPLv3.
         - No  : GPLv3 packages will not be selected and not display in the next step.

         To make sure the files in rootfs have correct uid and gid, notice that:
          * When rootfs is finished, please compress it into a tarball in the
            current terminal to keep the pseudo environment.
          * When unpack rootfs, please use sudo command with "--numeric-owner" option.

            For example:
            -------------------------------------------------------------------
             $ . enviroment-smart.sh /home/test/x86_rootfs /home/test/x86_rpm
             $ smart --rootfs-dir=/home/test/x86_rootfs  --interface=tgui
             $ cd /home/test/
             $ tar cvf - x86-rootfs | (cd $DEST_DIR ;sudo tar xvf - --numeric-owner)
            -------------------------------------------------------------------
